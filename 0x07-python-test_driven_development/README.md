                               Test-driven development(TDD)


this is a project on the TDD concept
this concept is about creating tests for functions before even creating the function which is a new concept for us

we will implement this concept in the next function and each one will have it's testcases


0-add_integer.py:
A function that adds to integers
tests/0-add_integer.txt: the test cases for the add function
