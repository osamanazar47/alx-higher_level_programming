::

Calling the function with a non integer will raise an error
  >>> print_square('osama')
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  TypeError: size must be an integer

::

Calling the function with a float type would raise a TypeError
  >>> print_square(3.2)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  TypeError: size must be an integer

::

Also when calling it with a size less than zero an error will be raised
  >>> print_square(-1)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ValueError: size must be >= 0

::

But the if size is a float and is less than 0 a TypeError would be raised not a ValueError
  >>> print_square(-2.5)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  TypeError: size must be an integer

::

  >>> print_square(1)
  #
  >>> print_square(0)
  
when size is zero the function deos not output anything
