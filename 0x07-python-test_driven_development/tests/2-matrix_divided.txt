matrix_divided - this is a function that divids all the elements of a matrix by an integer or a float

 >>>matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6]
 ]
 
this is a function that divides all the elements of a matrix by a div and return a new matrix
 
the elements will be divided and then rounded to a maximum of 2 decimal places
 
 >>>print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
 [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]
 
The original matrix is left unchanged.

::
can't divide the elements of the matrix by 0

 >>>print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
 Traceback (most recent call last)
 ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

::

 >>>matrix = [[1, 2], [4, 5, 6]]
 >>>print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
 Traceback (most recent call last)
 TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size
 
Each row of the matrix must be of the same size

::

 >>>matrix = [[1, 'osama', 3], [4, 5, 6]]
 >>>print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
 Traceback (most recent call last)
 TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
 
Each element of the list must be an integer or a float

 >>>matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
 >>>print(matrix_divided(matrix, 'haha'))
 Traceback (most recent call last)
 TypeError: div must be a number
 
The div must be a integer or a float just like the elements
 
::

 >>>matrix = []
 >>>print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
 []
